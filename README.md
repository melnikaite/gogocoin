##Challenge

You are asked to write smart contract s for an ETH staking app.

- User can stake their ETH (Constant APR 10%)
- User gets rewarded in devUSDC (an ERC20 token you will create as well) Assume that devUSDC is always worth $1
- Minimum amount to stake is 5 ETH
- User can withdraw his staked ETH at anytime along with the rewards in devUSDC To get the price of ETH you will need to use a price oracle from chainlink

##Submission

Submission should be in the form of:

1. Github repo with the contract code
2. Deployed contracts to Rinkeby
3. Verified contracts on etherscan
